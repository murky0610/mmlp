				<p class="description">How far do you have to travel to find yourself? 
            And what sacrifices are you willing to make to
             get there? Veiga Grétarsdóttir is the first
              person in the world to attempt to kayak the
               1,300 mile circumference of Iceland,
                counter-clockwise and against the current,
                 an achievement that has been compared 
                 to climbing K2. Veiga’s personal 
                 journey is no less remarkable. She 
                 was born 44 years ago as a boy in a fishing village 
                 on the far west coast of Iceland. By the age of 38 Veigar
                  had a wife and family but decided that she could no longer
                   live as a man and decided to undergo gender reassignment.
                    The inner struggle for Veigar to become Veiga was a 
                    journey as difficult if not more so than the solo kayak
                     expedition she undertakes. These two stories of 
                     conflict and struggle are intertwined as the film 
                     follows her amazing 103 day journey around Iceland, 
                     with the magical, rugged coastline of the country a 
                     backdrop to the story of Veiga’s transition</p>
